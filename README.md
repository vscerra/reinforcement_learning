# 🚀 Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains **modular implementations** of **stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms**, and **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)** inspired by Sutton & Barto’s *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. The project is structured to support 

 -**parameter tuning, experimentation, and visualization** of different bandit algorithms (Greedy, Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, Gradient Bandit, and Thompson Sampling)
 -**a gridworld example** of MDPs including Monte Carlo sampling, value propagation from terminal states, optimal paths for maximizing long-term reward, and clear visualizations
